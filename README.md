# GoBarber

This repository contains the files developed for the GoBarber project.

This platform aims to use the concepts of backend (node), frontend (react.js) and mobile (react native) from the JS ecosystem.

The Gobarber project was developed to be a solution for scheduling a barber shop. In the web application, it is possible to consult the schedules of the professional, and through mobile, it is possible for users, in turn, to make service schedules with the professional they want.

# Get started

The project is available in 3 folders. Respectively :

<ul>
  <li>/gobarberapi - Node.js</li>
  <li>/gobarberweb - React.js</li>
  <li>/gobarberapp - React Native</li>
</ul>

After cloning the repository, simply browse to any of these folders, and run the following commands:

- "npm install" or "yarn install" to install the dependencies for each project;

- "npm run start" or "yarn start" to run project

### Details

To execute the project of the folder gobarberweb[react] or gobarberapp[react native], it is necessary to execute the project of the folder 'gobarberapi', due to the consumption of the api available in this application.

I recommend you install /gobarberapi first and view the other projects.
